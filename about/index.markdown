I work on semantics and its interfaces with syntax and pragmatics. I graduated from the department of linguistics at MIT in September 2021, and now I am a post-doctoral researcher as part of the LeibnizDream project in the Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS).

My dissertation offers a new model of the syntax-semantics mapping of nominal phi-features (number, gender, person), in light of empirical problems with current models. The thesis can be found here: https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/006181.

I also have work on other domains, including Scalar Implicatures and their interaction with presuppositions. For example: https://semprag.org/article/view/sp.14.11.
