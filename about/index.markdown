I am a theoretical linguist. My research interest, broadly speaking, is on semantics and its interfaces with syntax and pragmatics. I have work in a number of empirical domains, including: Scalar Implicatures, anaphora and binding, ellipsis.

I graduated from the department of linguistics at MIT in September 2021, and now I am a post-doctoral researcher as part of the LeibnizDream project in the Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS).
